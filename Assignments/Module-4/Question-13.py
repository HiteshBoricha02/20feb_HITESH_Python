        - Errors is the problem due to that our program get's terminated before its completion.\n
        - Exception Handling is nothing but runtime errors and it occurs due to incorrect logics.
        - when error occurs instead of terminating program we can move to the next process with the help of exception.    
        - eg. when we try to divide any numbers with zero or we are importing something that is not available.
